## Welcome to the /dev/programmer GitHub Page

Hello, I'm Adam! Check out my hobby blog at [devprogrammer.com](https://devprogrammer.com).

I love writing and have published several articles independently and as part of the devprogrammer project. Sometimes, when I write code to tinker with, it ends up as a public repository on my GitHub.

I also share knowledge in bite-sized chunks on social media â€“ check the links on the left if you're curious ðŸ¤“

Additionally, I've authored articles on various platforms, all compiled [here](https://devprogrammercom.github.io/).

Thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to the /dev/programmer GitHub Page

Hello, I'm Adam! You can check out my hobby blog at [devprogrammer.com](https://devprogrammer.com).

I enjoy writing and have published several articles both individually and as part of the devprogrammer project. Often, I develop code for my projects and experiments, which I share publicly on this GitHub page.

Additionally, I've authored articles on various platforms. You can find all my writings compiled [here](https://devprogrammercom.github.io/).

Thanks for stopping by 👋
